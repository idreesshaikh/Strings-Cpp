# Strings-Cpp

The **Abstract String** is a programmer-defined linear ordering of objects from a finite set of objects termed an alphabet. The alphabet may be restricted to alphanumeric and punctuation characters but may also include additional mark-up information such as a new line character.  Strings, unlike a more general list, are generally assumed to have information coded not only in the individual characters but also in the ordering of the characters. (The significance of an object in a general container does not usually change based on the placement of other objects within the container.)
